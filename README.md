# automl-action
A simple autoML system using pycaret that runs in github actions

This is based on the tutorial in (TDS)[git@github.com:spowers42/automl-action.git] as well as (FastAI)[https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/16/auto-ml2/].  It is primarily my own experimentation to explore my own home brew automl along with docker and github actions.
